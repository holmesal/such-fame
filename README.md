Just a little portfolio app to play around with famo.us.

TODO
===

* finalize list of projects/circles & write copy
* add https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-angular-templates to cache templates
* find the HERO presentation video
* use ng-show/hide instead of ng-if, to kill lazy-loading - this doesn't really work well
* fix bug around toggling modes when not scrolled all the way to the top
* package navigator into a directive, clean up the main controller a bit
* add angular-ui-router to be able to link directly to projects
* add drag gesture (rotational) and pinch gesture (zoom in/out)
* add rotational spring
* add springs to text/etc underneath circles (face on one of the circles?)
* make links more interesting WITH PHYSICS
