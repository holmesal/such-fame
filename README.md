Just a little portfolio app to play around with famo.us.

TODO
===


* try a new approach for image loading events - make an onload directive, emit load event on rootscope, catch it in a controller, and force famo.us to re-compute the render tree
* find the HERO presentation video
* use a fa-sequential-layout anywhere where things might lazy-load in
* package navigator into a directive, clean up the main controller a bit
* add rotational drifting motion
* convert circle scaling from a switch to a transitionable
* kill overscroll
* add angular-ui-router to be able to link directly to projects
* add drag gesture (rotational) and pinch gesture (zoom in/out)
* add springs to text/etc underneath circles (face on one of the circles?)
* make links more interesting WITH PHYSICS
