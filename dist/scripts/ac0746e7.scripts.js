My name is Alonso Holmes. Uh-lawn-so.\n\n<br><br>\n\nI\'m an engineer, a designer, and a product person. I\'ve got the breadth of experience to be able to hack my way through nearly any problem, and a knack for attracting people that have the depth I don\'t.\n\n<br><br>\n\nI\'m a fullstack engineer - and for me, fullstack touches mobile, frontend, backend, hardware - even embedded systems. My formal education is in aerospace engineering. I\'m a voracious learner, and I love solving complex problems under intense pressure.\n\n<br><br>\n\nI\'m also a product person, and I\'ve spent the last few years designing, building, and launching products with the other members of the studio I founded, called <a href="http://mtnlab.io" target="_blank">MountainLab</a>. Our first headquarters was literally on top of a mountain.\n\n<!-- I have a bachelors degree in aeronautical engineering. This education was dangerous, because it taught me that anything can be learned. I still love everything that flies, and I think it’s our destiny to become a multiplanetary civilization. I want to get a doctorate in something, but I haven’t decided what. Particle physics might be fun. \n\n\nI prefer decentralized systems with flat hierarchies, but sometimes they aren’t the best way to get things done. I think advertising is a shitty revenue model for the internet, and I’d like to prove that a better one exists. I’m allergic to bureaucracy, but I value the role of the military-academia-industrial triangle in putting a man on the moon and inventing the (first) internet.  -->\n\n<!-- <br><br> -->\n\n<!-- I admire Norman Foster, Ellsworth Kelley, John Singer Sargent, Thom Yorke, Earnest Hemingway, Douglas Engelbart, Hunter Thompson, Jack Kerouac, and Siddhartha Gautama.  -->\n\n<!-- <br><br> -->\n\n\n<!-- The background image for this site is a shot of the Apollo 13 astronauts building a scrubber to remove excess C02 from the spacecraft, so that they can stay alive until they get back to Earth.

Back in 2014, Google bought a company called Skybox. Skybox launches and operates a small fleet of earth-imaging satellites (current population: 2). After returning from India in late 2014 (didn\'t find my guru, maybe next trip), I learned through a mutual friend that Skybox/Google were looking for a top-notch frontend developer to consult for a few months. I headed to Mountain View at the beginning of May.\n<br><br>\nI spent 6 months working at the googleplex alongside some of the most talented people I\'ve ever met. I learned the intricacies of building product inside an organization like google, from the minutia of the build system and source control, to the process for deploying code to production, to the higher-level ways that different teams interact. It was such an incredible experience, I ended up staying twice as long as originally planned.\n<br><br>\nUnfortunately, I can\'t give precise details on this project, as much of it hasn\'t been publicly launched yet (puns! space puns!).

Instead of the phone being a single package of processor, battery, screen, and so on, Project Ara bundles each of those components into modules that can be upgraded or swapped. Going on a long trip? Swap in an extra battery. Crack your screen? Just replace the screen, not the rest of the phone. There are even some fun <a href="http://www.designboom.com/technology/lapka-google-project-ara-haute-couture-blocks-01-20-2015/" target="_blank">concept modules</a> that were dreamed up by the folks at Lapka.\n<br><br>\nProject Ara is under Google\'s Advanced Technology and Projects Division. When they reached out to us, our mandate was very simple - assume as little as possible about the device in it\'s current form, and identify opportunities to present users with truly magical experiences. In their words, "Find the Gems".\n<br><br>\nWe\'re really looking forward to sharing some of our process and ideas around this project, but we\'ll need to wait until Project Ara officially launches.\n</p>\n<div class="links">\n  <a class="link" href="http://projectara.com" target="_blank">projectara.com</a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class="projectTitle">Salute</h1>\n<p class="description">\nAfter we launched <a href="http://getshortwave.com" target="_blank">Shortwave</a>, Vishal and the rest of the founding team at Salute reached out to us. They envisioned a better way to network, and they wondered if some of the proprietary tech that powered shortwave could be repurposed to make it easier to connect with people after meeting them at an event. The short answer was an emphatic yes, and soon we were off an running on a prototype.\n<br><br>\nBecause this project was so urgent (they wanted to launch as soon as possible), we parallelized design and engineering as much as possible. I helped out a bit on the UX side, but I spent most of my time architecting the complex ways that devices would interact over BLE. Shortwave was a proof-of-concept for an iBeacon-based communications protocol (lovingly called WTFBeacon), and Salute gave me a chance to refine and scale it.\n<br><br>\nSalute is currently still in a closed beta, but keep an eye on them!\n<br><br>\n<strong>Tech used:</strong> nodejs, coffeescript, firebase, objective-c, javascript\n</p>\n<div class="links">\n  <a class="link" href="http://salute.io" target="_blank">salute.io</a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class="projectTitle">Radius Networks</h1>\n<p class="description">\nI\'ve been reading Doug\'s <a href="" target="_blank">Beekn blog</a> for several years, so I jumped at the opportunity to work with him at Radius Networks. They\'re building out an iBeacon infrastructure management platform - the sort of thing that a city would use to control a massive citywide iBeacon installation. Lots of fun challenges there. I worked mostly on the web side, building the tools that would allow beacon owners to control what in-range customers could see and interact with.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Tech used:</strong> angular, grunt, sass, javascript\n</p>\n<div class="links">\n  <a class="link" href="http://radiusnetworks.com" target="_blank">radiusnetworks.com</a>\n</div>'),a.put("views/projects/hashtag.html",'<img class="media stretch" ng-src="images/0eb882d6.imac.png">\n\n<p class="description">\n\n\nWe built Hashtag to scratch an itch that we had - we were working on several consulting projects at the same time, and we wanted a way to share a chat room with clients. Every tool we tried (slack, hipchat, etc) seemed built to be used inside the walls of a single organization, and we realized that what we were after was something a little more like IRC - anyone can join a channel, just by knowing the name. As awesome as IRC is, though, it doesn’t have the friendliest interface, and we wanted something that worked on mobile as well as on desktop.\n\n<br><br>\n\nSo we built it! We called it hashtag, after the symbol that precedes channel names on IRC (twitter hashtags came later). It’s still in beta, but we’ve been using it to keep in touch internationally, and so far it’s been awesome. We made the barrier to starting “channels” really low (you just type in a name, and if it doesn’t exist it’s created), so we’ve found ourselves starting a ton of channels, and abandoning them later.\n\n<br><br>\n\nI built this in collaboration with Ethan Sherr and Matthew Kulp. Ethan was able to simultaneously build iOS and Android versions faster than I thought possible, and Matt knocked the design out of the park. I architected and built the backend (node and firebase) and the desktop/web apps (angular, wrapped in node-webkit).\n\n</p>\n\n<div class="links">\n  <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://joinhashtag.com">Visit the hashtag website</a>\n</div>'),a.put("views/projects/hero.html",'<div class="videoWrapper media">\n  <iframe ng-if="showVideo" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/37163018" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p class="description">\n\nH.E.R.O. (the Humanitarian Emergency Response Operative) is a rugged drone designed to ferry large amounts of humanitarian supplies between improvised landing strips and nearby airports. H.E.R.O. is designed to be deployed quickly and in large numbers in the event of a natural disaster.\n\n<br><br>\n\nBecause of it\'s unique folding wing and tail geometry, H.E.R.O. can be transported in the cargo bay of a standard C-130J military transport aircraft. Once it arrives at an airport or military base near the disaster area, H.E.R.O. can be loaded with up to 1800 pounds of humanitarian cargo by a single operator. It can then ferry this cargo anywhere within a 500 nautical mile range, and can land on rough/unpaved surfaces like soccer fields or dirt roads. H.E.R.O. is able to unload itself autonomously and return to pick up more supplies, all without an operator in the loop.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis was my capstone project as an undergraduate aerospace engineering student at Boston University. I led a team of 6, and as the design lead I worked between the various subsystems (propulsion, structures, aerodynamics, control systems, and autonomous mechanisms) to keep the overall aircraft design on-track while putting out fires on a subsystem-level and staying withing weight and power budgets.\n\n<br><br>\n\nEverything about a STOL (Short TakeOff and Landing) aircraft is large - large wings to provide ample lift at low speeds, large control surfaces (and a long tail moment arm) to pitch for takeoff at low speeds, and a large engine/propeller combination to accelerate quickly. At the same time, we were working against a competing geometric constraint that demanded our aircraft be as compact as possible - we needed to fit in the cargo bay of a larger aircraft. Finding the limits of these two diametrically opposed design constraints was what made this project hugely interesting and rewarding.\n\n</p>\n\n<div class="links">\n  <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/z98d9964hbu36g5/hero.pdf?dl=0">Read the design report</a>\n  <!-- <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/37163018">Watch the presentation</a> -->\n</div>'),a.put("views/projects/mountainlab.html",'\n\n<p class="description">\n\nI co-founded a studio with a couple of other crazy engineers and designers.

Audience is an experiment in social podcast listening - it\'s a podcast player that gives you the ability to have a conversation right on top of the podcast itself. You can like, share, and comment on specific moments *inside* a podcast.\n<br><br>\nThis is also my first large project in react-native. So far, it\'s an incredible framework that I feel really has the potential to bring the speed of web development to mobile platforms. Flux (specifically redux) is an amazingly simple architecture that makes complex applications really easy to reason about. React is similarly elegant for the view layer. Using both of these technologies at the same time to build truly native applications is simply delightful.\n<br><br>\nWhile working on Audience, I\'ve also gotten plenty of practice diving down to the Obj-C + Swift level and writing react-native wrappers for iOS components - streaming audio, disk persistence, that sort of thing.\n</p>\n<div class="links">\n	<a class="link" href="http://podcast.firebaseapp.com" target="_blank">podcast.firebaseapp.com</a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class="projectTitle">Hashtag</h1>\n<img class="media stretch" ng-src="images/0eb882d6.imac.png">\n<p class="description">\nHashtag was an experiment in global, public chat. We were using slack a lot at the time, and we were bothered by how difficult it was to bring clients and friends into our Slack instance. We felt like the experience of using Slack was excellent, but it was really built more for enclosed teams than for distributed groups.\n<br><br>\nWe killed the project eventually. My personal post-mortem is that the "everything for everyone" nature of a concept as large as Hashtag paralyzed us when it came to actually bringing the idea to market. <a href="http://discordapp.com" target="_blank">Discord</a> (targeted gamers with an alternative to TeamSpeak servers, then expanded to open-source orgs) or <a href="http://gitter.im" target="_blank">Gitter</a> (targeted open-source orgs from the get-go) are good examples of how this idea could have been better brought to market by focusing initially on a small group with a tangible problem, then slowly starting to bring in other use-cases.\n<br><br>\nWe did gain a ton of valuable experience in working as a distributed team, and building applications that run on the desktop. Also, chat apps are really, really fun to build.\n</p>\n<div class="links">\n	<a class="link" href="http://joinhashtag.com" target="_blank">joinhashtag.com</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 class="projectTitle">Shortwave</h1>\n<img class="media stretch" ng-src="images/9ffef316.shortwave.png">\n<p class="description">\nCalled a "real-world early-adopter hunt" (<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/shortwave-2" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a>) and a "consumer use-case for iBeacons" (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/12/shortwave-shows-off-anonymous-chat-as-another-consumer-use-case-for-ibeacons/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>), Shortwave is a chat room with a 150-foot radius. It\'s a social network without a friends list, where your "network" is defined solely by your location.\n<br><br>\nUnder the hood, a Bluetooth Low Energy signaling protocol we lovingly call WTFBeacon powers the core of Shortwave. It\'s an elegant set of workarounds for limitations that Apple has imposed on background use of CoreBluetooth and CoreLocation. It\'s a little complex - I wrote a blog post describing in detail how it works, and I still get emails along the lines of "can you please implement this for me?"\n<br><br>\nShortwave was a fun experiment. We had good traction after launching it, and considered raising a small round to support continued growth. Ultimately, it was more interesting to us as a side project than a business, but we still keep the servers running.

These distortions become important, however, when the images are taken from aircraft- and spacecraft- based camera systems. Each pixel of an image generated by a satellite maps to an exact location on the earth’s surface - a specific latitude and longitude. Because the distances involved are so great, even a tiny distortion in the camera lens can lead to an error of meters (or even kilometers) on the ground. Photos from satellite and aerial cameras are commonly used to plan roads, measure the progression of global warming, and asses the impact of natural disasters, so the accuracy of this imagery is hugely important.\n\n<br><br>\n\nNo lens is perfect. Fortunately, if you can map the distortion of the lens at various points, you can post-process the imagery and correct for the error. To do this, you take a picture of a matrix of targets with known geometry (you know the precise position of each target in the matrix). For each target, you then compare the known target position to the position perceived by the camera. This gives you an error vector for that specific location on the lens. By repeating this process with the camera in various orientations, you can produce a “map” of the lens distortion -  a vector field of the positional errors at various locations. Then, you simply skew any images produced by the camera/lens in the opposite way to produce a “corrected” image.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThe distortion of a lens is generally mapped before flight, but during launch a satellite is subjected to significant vibration and g-loading that can change this distortion. In addition, the lens (as well as the housing and surrounding satellite structure) can be subjected to extreme temperature cycles (up to -129 to 260 celsius) over the lifetime of a mission, which can further change the lens distortion as time goes on. Therefore, it would be nice if a lens could be calibrated after launch, and even more desirable if it could be calibrated every few orbits. The same goes for aircraft-mounted cameras - post-processing the imagery to correct for errors would be preferable to relying on a pre-flight calibration.\n\n<br><br>\n\nTo provide a way to characterize the distortion of an image from a satellite- or aircraft- mounted camera, we (myself and several other interns and researchers from the USGS EROS Data Center) built a matrix of targets (painted on roadways) that spanned the area of a city. These targets were concentric white and black circles, with a diameter of about 5 feet, and were deployed mostly in the center of intersections and other high-visibility areas. To record the precise location of the center of each target, we surveyed them using differential GPS (where a nearby control point of known location is used to correct the positional readings from a second, roving receiver). We built two of these city-scale calibration ranges - one in Rolla, MO, and one in Pueblo, CO (in addition to the existing range in Sioux Falls, SD).\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n<div class="links">\n  <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/@43.7384188,-96.6261386,128m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en">See a target on Google Maps</a>\n</div>\n'),a.put("views/projects/shortwave.html",'<img class="media stretch" ng-src="images/9ffef316.shortwave.png">\n\n<p class="description">\n\nShortwave is a tiny little chat room for you and everyone within 100 feet. The mode we usually use our phones in pulls us out of our surroundings and onto the web - instead of talking to the people next to us in line for coffee, we check twitter. We wanted to build something that hacked that urge to pull out your phone, and got you to do something instead that could end in a real, human conversation.\n\n<br><br>\n\nAlso, it’s anonymous, which was what most of the press focused on. To us, this was an obvious choice that mirrored the amount you know about the people around you - icon/color equals face/shirt. Speculation abounded that Shortwave would be rife with bullies and creepers. In reality, people were charmingly civil, if a little nervous and awkward. Niv summed this up best in the Product Hunt comments - “Shortwave is a real-world early adopter scavenger hunt”.\n\n<br><br>\n\nPowering Shortwave is something called wtfBeacon, which is a library that combines iBeacons, CoreBluetooth, and websockets in a way that I feel alternatively proud and deeply ashamed of. Proud because it works, despite several reasons it shouldn’t.
