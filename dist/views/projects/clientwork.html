Back in 2014, Google bought a company called Skybox. Skybox launches and operates a small fleet of earth-imaging satellites (current population: 2). After returning from India in late 2014 (didn't find my guru, maybe next trip), I learned through a mutual friend that Skybox/Google were looking for a top-notch frontend developer to consult for a few months. I headed to Mountain View at the beginning of May.<br><br>I spent 6 months working at the googleplex alongside some of the most talented people I've ever met. I learned the intricacies of building product inside an organization like google, from the minutia of the build system and source control, to the process for deploying code to production, to the higher-level ways that different teams interact. It was such an incredible experience, I ended up staying twice as long as originally planned.<br><br>Unfortunately, I can't give precise details on this project, as much of it hasn't been publicly launched yet (puns! space puns!). Stay tuned.<br><br><strong>Tech used:</strong> polymer, angular, bazel, gulp, javascript, go</p><h1 class="projectTitle">Project Ara (Google ATAP)</h1><p class="description">If you aren't familiar with Google's Project Ara, it's a modular smartphone that promises to change the way that you look at your device. Instead of the phone being a single package of processor, battery, screen, and so on, Project Ara bundles each of those components into modules that can be upgraded or swapped. Going on a long trip? Swap in an extra battery. Crack your screen? Just replace the screen, not the rest of the phone. There are even some fun <a href="http://www.designboom.com/technology/lapka-google-project-ara-haute-couture-blocks-01-20-2015/" target="_blank">concept modules</a> that were dreamed up by the folks at Lapka.<br><br>Project Ara is under Google's Advanced Technology and Projects Division. When they reached out to us, our mandate was very simple - assume as little as possible about the device in it's current form, and identify opportunities to present users with truly magical experiences. In their words, "Find the Gems".<br><br>We're really looking forward to sharing some of our process and ideas around this project, but we'll need to wait until Project Ara officially launches.</p><div class="links"><a class="link" href="http://projectara.com" target="_blank">projectara.com</a></div><h1 class="projectTitle">Salute</h1><p class="description">After we launched <a href="http://getshortwave.com" target="_blank">Shortwave</a>, Vishal and the rest of the founding team at Salute reached out to us. They envisioned a better way to network, and they wondered if some of the proprietary tech that powered shortwave could be repurposed to make it easier to connect with people after meeting them at an event. The short answer was an emphatic yes, and soon we were off an running on a prototype.<br><br>Because this project was so urgent (they wanted to launch as soon as possible), we parallelized design and engineering as much as possible. I helped out a bit on the UX side, but I spent most of my time architecting the complex ways that devices would interact over BLE. Shortwave was a proof-of-concept for an iBeacon-based communications protocol (lovingly called WTFBeacon), and Salute gave me a chance to refine and scale it.<br><br>Salute is currently still in a closed beta, but keep an eye on them!<br><br><strong>Tech used:</strong> nodejs, coffeescript, firebase, objective-c, javascript</p><div class="links"><a class="link" href="http://salute.io" target="_blank">salute.io</a></div><h1 class="projectTitle">Radius Networks</h1><p class="description">I've been reading Doug's <a href="" target="_blank">Beekn blog</a> for several years, so I jumped at the opportunity to work with him at Radius Networks. They're building out an iBeacon infrastructure management platform - the sort of thing that a city would use to control a massive citywide iBeacon installation. Lots of fun challenges there. I worked mostly on the web side, building the tools that would allow beacon owners to control what in-range customers could see and interact with.<br><br><strong>Tech used:</strong> angular, grunt, sass, javascript</p><div class="links"><a class="link" href="http://radiusnetworks.com" target="_blank">radiusnetworks.com</a></div>
