<img class="media stretch" ng-src="images/2bfdb6ce.targets.png"><p class="description">Lens distortion isn’t usually a big deal - the imperfections are so tiny that they’re seldom noticeable. These distortions become important, however, when the images are taken from aircraft- and spacecraft- based camera systems. Each pixel of an image generated by a satellite maps to an exact location on the earth’s surface - a specific latitude and longitude. Because the distances involved are so great, even a tiny distortion in the camera lens can lead to an error of meters (or even kilometers) on the ground. Photos from satellite and aerial cameras are commonly used to plan roads, measure the progression of global warming, and asses the impact of natural disasters, so the accuracy of this imagery is hugely important.<br><br>No lens is perfect. Fortunately, if you can map the distortion of the lens at various points, you can post-process the imagery and correct for the error. To do this, you take a picture of a matrix of targets with known geometry (you know the precise position of each target in the matrix). For each target, you then compare the known target position to the position perceived by the camera. This gives you an error vector for that specific location on the lens. By repeating this process with the camera in various orientations, you can produce a “map” of the lens distortion - a vector field of the positional errors at various locations. Then, you simply skew any images produced by the camera/lens in the opposite way to produce a “corrected” image.<br><br>The distortion of a lens is generally mapped before flight, but during launch a satellite is subjected to significant vibration and g-loading that can change this distortion. In addition, the lens (as well as the housing and surrounding satellite structure) can be subjected to extreme temperature cycles (up to -129 to 260 celsius) over the lifetime of a mission, which can further change the lens distortion as time goes on. Therefore, it would be nice if a lens could be calibrated after launch, and even more desirable if it could be calibrated every few orbits. The same goes for aircraft-mounted cameras - post-processing the imagery to correct for errors would be preferable to relying on a pre-flight calibration.<br><br>To provide a way to characterize the distortion of an image from a satellite- or aircraft- mounted camera, we (myself and several other interns and researchers from the USGS EROS Data Center) built a matrix of targets (painted on roadways) that spanned the area of a city. These targets were concentric white and black circles, with a diameter of about 5 feet, and were deployed mostly in the center of intersections and other high-visibility areas. To record the precise location of the center of each target, we surveyed them using differential GPS (where a nearby control point of known location is used to correct the positional readings from a second, roving receiver). We built two of these city-scale calibration ranges - one in Rolla, MO, and one in Pueblo, CO (in addition to the existing range in Sioux Falls, SD).<br><br><br></p><div class="links"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/@43.7384188,-96.6261386,128m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en">Google Map an example target</a></div>
