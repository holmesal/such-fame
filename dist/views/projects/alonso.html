I love complex engineering problems, realtime data, hooking the web up to the physical world, and missions to improve life.<br><br>The background image for this site is a shot of the Apollo 13 astronauts building a scrubber to remove excess C02 from the spacecraft, so that they can stay alive until they get back to Earth.
