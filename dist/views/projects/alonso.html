Uh-lawn-so.<br><br>I like solving problems by building things, which I suppose makes me an engineer. But these are very thoughtfully designed solutions, so that makes me a designer. And sometimes I write code, which would make me a developer.<br><br>Most of the things I build these days live on the web - I'm a frontend and backend web developer and designer. I love playing with hardware, and finding ways to hook amazing web interactions up to physical devices. I'll never long-poll a server again.<br><br>I'm still incredibly interested in democratizing access to space, and one of my goals is to find a way to apply the extremely rapid software development process I've learned in startups to the design, integration, and launch of space vehicles. <!-- I have a bachelors degree in aeronautical engineering. This education was dangerous, because it taught me that anything can be learned. I still love everything that flies, and I think it’s our destiny to become a multiplanetary civilization. I want to get a doctorate in something, but I haven’t decided what. Particle physics might be fun. 


I prefer decentralized systems with flat hierarchies, but sometimes they aren’t the best way to get things done. I think advertising is a shitty revenue model for the internet, and I’d like to prove that a better one exists. I’m allergic to bureaucracy, but I value the role of the military-academia-industrial triangle in putting a man on the moon and inventing the (first) internet.  --><!-- <br><br> --><!-- I admire Norman Foster, Ellsworth Kelley, John Singer Sargent, Thom Yorke, Earnest Hemingway, Douglas Engelbart, Hunter Thompson, Jack Kerouac, and Siddhartha Gautama.  --><!-- <br><br> --><!-- The background image for this site is a shot of the Apollo 13 astronauts building a scrubber to remove excess C02 from the spacecraft, so that they can stay alive until they get back to Earth. This is a hack of legendary status from a time when we felt like we could do anything. I like that mindset. Let's build epic shit. --><br><br>This page was built in famo.us - here's a <a href="https://medium.com/@alonsoholmes/new-digs-972d8cae7fdd" target="_blank">blog post on how</a>. These days, I'm really into react-native. Reeeeeaallllly into it.<br><br>Also, I consult as a web developer and designer.
