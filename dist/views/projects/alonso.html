Uh-lawn-so.<br><br>I like solving problems by building things, which I suppose makes me an engineer. But these are very thoughtfully designed solutions, so that makes me a designer. And sometimes I write code, which would make me a developer. I have a bachelors degree in aeronautical engineering. This education was dangerous, because it taught me that anything can be learned. I still love everything that flies, and I think it’s our destiny to become a multiplanetary civilization. I want to get a doctorate in something, but I haven’t decided what. Particle physics might be fun. I prefer decentralized systems with flat hierarchies, but sometimes they aren’t the best way to get things done. I think advertising is a shitty revenue model for the internet, and I’d like to prove that a better one exists. I’m allergic to bureaucracy, but I value the role of the military-academia-industrial triangle in putting a man on the moon and inventing the (first) internet. I think that Norman Foster, Ellsworth Kelley, John Singer Sargent, Thom Yorke, Earnest Hemingway, Douglas Engelbart, Hunter Thompson, Jack Kerouac, and Siddhartha Gautama have done great work. The background image for this site is a shot of the Apollo 13 astronauts building a scrubber to remove excess C02 from the spacecraft, so that they can stay alive until they get back to Earth. This is a hack of legendary status from a time when we felt like we could do anything. I like that mindset. Build epic shit. No more laundry startups.<br><br><br></p><p>give me a shout:</p><p>@alonsoholmes on <a href="http://twitter.com/alonsoholmes" target="_blank">twitter</a> and <a href="http://medium.com/@alonsoholmes" target="_blank">medium</a>.</p><p>plz no spam to <a href="mailto:yo@alonso.io">yo@alonso.io</a></p>
