Uh-lawn-so.<br><br>I'm an engineer, a designer, and a product person. I've got the breadth of experience to be able to hack my way through nearly any problem, and a knack for attracting people that have the depth I don't.<br><br>I'm a fullstack engineer - and for me, fullstack touches mobile, frontend, backend, hardware - even embedded systems. My formal education is in aerospace engineering. I'm a voracious learner, and I love solving complex problems under intense pressure.<br><br>I'm also a product person, and I've spent the last few years designing, building, and launching products with the other members of the studio I founded, called <a href="http://mtnlab.io" target="_blank">MountainLab</a>. Our first headquarters was literally on top of a mountain. <!-- I have a bachelors degree in aeronautical engineering. This education was dangerous, because it taught me that anything can be learned. I still love everything that flies, and I think it’s our destiny to become a multiplanetary civilization. I want to get a doctorate in something, but I haven’t decided what. Particle physics might be fun. 


I prefer decentralized systems with flat hierarchies, but sometimes they aren’t the best way to get things done. I think advertising is a shitty revenue model for the internet, and I’d like to prove that a better one exists. I’m allergic to bureaucracy, but I value the role of the military-academia-industrial triangle in putting a man on the moon and inventing the (first) internet.  --> <!-- <br><br> --> <!-- I admire Norman Foster, Ellsworth Kelley, John Singer Sargent, Thom Yorke, Earnest Hemingway, Douglas Engelbart, Hunter Thompson, Jack Kerouac, and Siddhartha Gautama.  --> <!-- <br><br> --> <!-- The background image for this site is a shot of the Apollo 13 astronauts building a scrubber to remove excess C02 from the spacecraft, so that they can stay alive until they get back to Earth. This is a hack of legendary status from a time when we felt like we could do anything. I like that mindset. Let's build epic shit. --><br><br>By the way - This page was built in famo.us. Here's a <a href="https://medium.com/@alonsoholmes/new-digs-972d8cae7fdd" target="_blank">blog post on how</a>.<br><br>Also, I do quite a bit of consulting, both as a developer and a product designer.
