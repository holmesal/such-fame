<img class="media stretch" ng-src="images/38e62a2e.imac.png"><p class="description">We built Hashtag to scratch an itch that we had - we were working on several consulting projects at the same time, and we wanted a way to share a chat room with clients. Every tool we tried (slack, hipchat, etc) seemed built to be used inside the walls of a single organization, and we realized that what we were after was something a little more like IRC - anyone can join a channel, just by knowing the name. As awesome as IRC is, though, it doesn’t have the friendliest interface, and we wanted something that worked on mobile as well as on desktop.<br><br>So we built it! We called it hashtag, after the symbol that precedes channel names on IRC (twitter hashtags came later). It’s still in beta, but we’ve been using it to keep in touch internationally, and so far it’s been awesome. We made the barrier to starting “channels” really low (you just type in a name, and if it doesn’t exist it’s created), so we’ve found ourselves starting a ton of channels, and abandoning them later.<br><br>I built this in collaboration with Ethan Sherr and Matthew Kulp. Ethan was able to simultaneously build iOS and Android versions faster than I thought possible, and Matt knocked the design out of the park. I architected and built the backend (node and firebase) and the desktop/web apps (angular, wrapped in node-webkit).</p><div class="links"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://joinhashtag.com">Visit the hashtag website</a></div>
